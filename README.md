#  Cloud + AI Journey (52 weeks)

Welcome to my Cloud + AI Engineer learning journey   

This repository documents my progress as I transition from a mechanical background into **Cloud, AI, and Machine Learning engineering**.

## What’s Inside
- `Hello.py` → my first Python program (Day 1)  
- Weekly commits as I progress through my **52-week Cloud + AI Engineer plan**  
- Projects will include:
  - Python automation scripts  
  - AWS cloud deployments  
  - Machine learning experiments  
  - MLOps workflows  

---

## Goals
- Become proficient in **Python, Linux, Git, and AWS**  
- Earn **AWS Developer Associate** and **AWS ML Specialty** certifications  
- Build a portfolio of **end-to-end AI + cloud projects**  
- Land a role as a **Cloud AI Engineer**

## Progress Tracker
- **Week 1:** Python basics, Git setup → `hello.py`, cipher project, README updates  
- **Week 2:** Python data structures → CSV cleaner, file organizer  
- **Week 3:** Linux & shell basics → `linux_basics.md` cheat sheet

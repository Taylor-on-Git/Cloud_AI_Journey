#  Cloud + AI Journey (52 weeks)

Welcome to my Cloud + AI Engineer learning journey   

This repository documents my progress as I transition from a mechanical background into **Cloud, AI, and Machine Learning engineering**.  

---

## What’s Inside
- `Hello.py` → my first Python program (Day 1)  
- Weekly commits as I progress through my **52-week Cloud + AI Engineer plan**  
- Projects will include:
  - Python automation scripts  
  - AWS cloud deployments  
  - Machine learning experiments  
  - MLOps workflows  

---

## Goals
- Become proficient in **Python, Linux, Git, and AWS**  
- Earn **AWS Developer Associate** and **AWS ML Specialty** certifications  
- Build a portfolio of **end-to-end AI + cloud projects**  
- Land a role as a **Cloud AI Engineer**  

---

## Progress Tracker
- **Day 5:** Git Branching + PR practice
- **Week 1:** Python basics, Git setup → `hello.py`, cipher project, README updates  
- **Week 2:** Python data structures → CSV cleaner, file organizer  
- **Week 3:** Linux & shell basics → `linux_basics.md` cheat sheet  
- **Week 4:** Git fluency → PR opened & merged, Git 101 notes 

I’ll update this repo regularly with new projects, notes, and code as I learn.

## Weekly Summaries

### Week 1 Summary

#### ✅ Wins
- Set up development environment: installed Python 3.13, Git, VS Code  
- Created first repo: `Cloud_AI_Journey` (moved out of OneDrive into `C:\Dev`)  
- Installed essential VS Code extensions (Python, Jupyter, GitLens, etc.)  
- Wrote and committed first Python script (`Hello.py`)  
- Created and polished `README.md`  
- Posted about the start of my journey on LinkedIn  

#### ❌ Misses
- No major misses — first week was mostly setup and environment  

#### 🚧 Blockers
- None — just learning the Git/GitHub workflow  

#### 🎯 Plan for Week 2
- Begin creating small Python scripts (file renamer, CSV parser, API fetcher)  
- Practice daily commits and GitHub pushes  
- Start logging blockers/fixes as they come up  

### Week 2 Summary

#### ✅ Wins
- Created and committed 3 Python scripts (file renamer, CSV parser, Pokémon API fetcher)  
- Got more confident with Git basics (add, commit, push, commit history)  
- Added inline comments and docstrings → portfolio-ready code  
- Solved real blockers (syntax errors, indentation issues, permission errors, repo clutter)  
- Pulled live data from PokéAPI 🎉  

#### ❌ Misses
- Lost ~10 days due to hardware setup + holiday  
- Extra time fixing repo clutter  

#### 🚧 Blockers
- Windows permissions blocking file deletion (fixed with `takeown` + PowerShell admin)  
- Python indentation + syntax errors (`else:` issue)  
- Repo clutter from cloning inside itself  

#### 🎯 Plan for Week 3
- Make scripts “talk” (CSV of Pokémon → API fetcher)  
- Practice Git branching (create branch, merge PR)  
- Update README with script explanations  
- Aim for daily micro-commits

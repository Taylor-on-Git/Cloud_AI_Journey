#  Cloud + AI Journey (52 weeks)

Welcome to my Cloud + AI Engineer learning journey   

This repository documents my progress as I transition from a mechanical background into **Cloud, AI, and Machine Learning engineering**.  

---

## What’s Inside
- `Hello.py` → my first Python program (Day 1)  
- Weekly commits as I progress through my **52-week Cloud + AI Engineer plan**  
- Projects will include:
  - Python automation scripts  
  - AWS cloud deployments  
  - Machine learning experiments  
  - MLOps workflows  

---

## Goals
- Become proficient in **Python, Linux, Git, and AWS**  
- Earn **AWS Developer Associate** and **AWS ML Specialty** certifications  
- Build a portfolio of **end-to-end AI + cloud projects**  
- Land a role as a **Cloud AI Engineer**  

---

## Progress Tracker
- **Day 5:** Git Branching + PR practice
- **Week 1:** Python basics, Git setup → `hello.py`, cipher project, README updates  
- **Week 2:** Python data structures → CSV cleaner, file organizer, API fetcher
- **Week 3:** Extra Python & Git practice (branching, PRs, script improvements)
- **Week 4:** Linux & shell basics → `linux_basics.md` cheat sheet  
- **Week 5:** Git fluency → PR opened & merged, Git 101 notes 

I’ll update this repo regularly with new projects, notes, and code as I learn.

## Weekly Summaries

### Week 1 Summary

#### git Wins
- Set up development environment: installed Python 3.13, Git, VS Code  
- Created first repo: `Cloud_AI_Journey` (moved out of OneDrive into `C:\Dev`)  
- Installed essential VS Code extensions (Python, Jupyter, GitLens, etc.)  
- Wrote and committed first Python script (`Hello.py`)  
- Created and polished `README.md`  
- Posted about the start of my journey on LinkedIn  

####  Misses
- No major misses — first week was mostly setup and environment  

####  Blockers
- None — just learning the Git/GitHub workflow  

####  Plan for Week 2
- Begin creating small Python scripts (file renamer, CSV parser, API fetcher)  
- Practice daily commits and GitHub pushes  
- Start logging blockers/fixes as they come up  

### Week 2 Summary

####  Wins
- Created and committed 3 Python scripts (file renamer, CSV parser, Pokémon API fetcher)  
- Got more confident with Git basics (add, commit, push, commit history)  
- Added inline comments and docstrings → portfolio-ready code  
- Solved real blockers (syntax errors, indentation issues, permission errors, repo clutter)  
- Pulled live data from PokéAPI 🎉  

####  Misses
- Lost ~10 days due to hardware setup + holiday  
- Extra time fixing repo clutter  

####  Blockers
- Windows permissions blocking file deletion (fixed with `takeown` + PowerShell admin)  
- Python indentation + syntax errors (`else:` issue)  
- Repo clutter from cloning inside itself  

### Week 3 Summary

#### Wins
- Built an end-to-end Pokémon data pipeline:
  - `csv_to_pokemon.py` → reads names from CSV, calls PokéAPI, writes `pokemon_data.csv`
  - Error logging to `pokemon_errors.csv` (missed/typo’d names)
  - `pokemon_type_analyzer.py` → counts types from output CSV
- Learned key Python tools/patterns:
  - `requests` + `.json()` for APIs
  - `csv` for reading/writing files
  - `collections.Counter` for quick tallies
  - `ast.literal_eval` to safely parse list strings (e.g., "['grass','poison']")
- Git confidence boost: branched, resolved conflicts, and pushed cleanly

#### Misses
- A few rebase/merge tangles that slowed momentum
- Spent time on local experiments not meant for GitHub (by design, but time-consuming)

#### Blockers
- Merge conflict in `csv_to_pokemon.py` (resolved by choosing simpler error-logging version)
- Indentation/syntax hiccups (missing colons, wrong indent levels)
- “Writer not defined” / write-while-read issues (fixed by separating read & write phases)

#### Plan for Week 4
- Start Linux & shell basics (Windows Terminal/PowerShell + WSL if needed)
  - Files/dirs: `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`
  - Viewing/searching: `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail -f`, `grep`
  - Permissions & exec: `chmod`, `whoami`
  - History & chaining: `history`, `|`, `>`, `>>`
- Create a **linux_basics.md** cheat sheet in the repo:
  - Each command with 1–2 line explanation + example
- Practice mini tasks:
  - Parse a log file with `grep` + `wc -l`
  - Batch-rename files with a one-liner
  - Write a tiny shell script (`.sh`) and run it
- Keep daily micro-commits (notes + small exercises)

### Week 4 Summary

#### Wins
- Installed and configured Ubuntu through WSL on Windows.
- Practiced foundational Linux commands:
  - Navigation: `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`
  - File management: `touch`, `echo`, `cat`, `rm`
  - Permissions and execution: `chmod` (symbolic + numeric modes)
- Learned to interpret permission strings (e.g., `-rwxr--r--`) and their numeric equivalents (`744`).
- Took detailed notes and screenshots while testing each command.

#### Misses
- Only completed one focused Linux session due to limited time.
- Didn’t yet reach ownership, `sudo`, or process management commands.

#### Blockers
- Minor confusion switching between PowerShell and WSL terminal environments.
- Time limitations across the week (reduced total learning hours).

#### Plan for Week 5
- Continue Linux Fundamentals (Part 2) + start Intro to Shell Scripting
- Ownership and access control: `chown`, `sudo`, `groups`, `whoami`
- Process management: `ps`, `top`, `kill`, `bg`, `fg`, `sleep`
- Redirection and piping review: `>`, `>>`, `|`, `grep`, `wc`, `sort`
- Write and execute a simple `.sh` shell script to automate a task
- Create a `linux_basics.md` cheat sheet summarizing all commands learned so far
- Commit cheat sheet and script to GitHub with clear commit messages

### Week 5 Summary

#### Wins
- Fully configured and re-installed Ubuntu WSL after earlier setup issues.
- Learned and practiced file ownership, permissions, and user/group management (chmod, chown, usermod, groups).
- Created and debugged multiple users (sam, taylor) and handled access-denied scenarios.
- Wrote and executed a full Bash script that:
  - Read user input
  - Used date command substitution (%A, %B, %d)
  - Added logic for weekends vs weekdays
  - Logged outputs with timestamps.
- Understood execution bits (-rwxr-xr-x) and variable expansion.
- Built strong intuition for Linux file structure, privileges, and command workflow.

#### Misses
- Minor delays from Ubuntu password reset and user access issues.
- Didn’t log daily notes in the tracking sheet (only GitHub summary).
- Haven’t yet combined Linux automation with external tools (next step).

#### Blockers
- Repeated “access denied” errors when adding sam to dev_project (resolved via correct group permissions).
- Confusion over directory context (/home vs /home/taylor) — now clarified.
- Small delays caused by environment reinstalls and resets.

#### Plan for Week 6
- Learn AWS CLI and Azure CLI basics (installation, configuration, test commands).
- Automate a simple cloud task using a shell script, e.g. list S3 buckets or Azure storage containers.
- Understand environment variables and credentials in shell scripting.
- Push your first automation script to GitHub with an explanatory README section.
- Continue reinforcing Linux habits: file redirection, logging, and error handling.
